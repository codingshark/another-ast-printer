Intro:
Printer of llvm-clang AST. This printer prints AST nodes type, which could help new users understand llvm-clang AST.
When a new user comes to llvm-clang, it may be difficult for the new user to find the information him/her interested in from the complex AST. This program prints C/C++ source code from AST together with the type information of the AST node such that the user could decide the AST node type which contains the information him/her interested in. The structure of AST is more clear with C/C++ source code and AST node type showing together.

Maintenance:
The current version is based on clang version 3.6.0. The following files should be updated accordingly, if new version of clang is released:
DeclPrinter
StmtPrinter
TypePrinter

All of DeclPrinter, StmtPrinter and TypePrinter are modified from the classes of the same name of llvm-clang.
